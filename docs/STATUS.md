# Pivot implementation status

Date: 2026-10-18

The Rust workspace and .NET 10/Avalonia solution are scaffolded. Architecture
records live in `docs/adr/` using `ADR-NNNN` identifiers. ADR-0001 records the
previously agreed graph-first design.

`pivot-types` provides `PivotDecimal`, a private `rust_decimal` wrapper with
decimal text parsing, integer construction, formatting, comparisons, and checked
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and negation. Arithmetic errors
distinguish overflow and division by zero. Unrepresentable literals are rejected.
No float conversion API is exposed. Arithmetic outputs are canonicalized; explicit
rounding supports seven modes with nearest/ties-away-from-zero as default. .NET
helpers expose the same behavior. A shared 10,099-vector suite passes for values,
errors, and scales, including seeded arithmetic cases and independent rounding
expectations. See `tests/decimal-parity/verify.py` and the numeric architecture note.

`pivot-core::expression` parses decimal literals, ASCII identifiers, unary signs,
binary arithmetic, and parentheses into an AST. Multiplication/division precede
addition/subtraction; binary operators associate left. Names are case-preserving
and unresolved. The AST has no evaluation or I/O behavior.

Editable models now support stable node IDs, named decimal inputs, computed nodes,
and immutable snapshots with captured inputs and model-scoped revisions. Snapshot
validation checks bound IDs, extracts forward/reverse dependencies, orders nodes, and
rejects cycles. See ADR-0002 and the model/snapshot architecture note.

Snapshot evaluation now supports selected outputs or all nodes, bound decimal
expressions, calculation-local state, typed arithmetic/dependency errors, and
immutable results retaining their snapshot revision. Isolated invocation accepts
temporary input overrides keyed by NodeId, with captured defaults and typed binding
validation. Independent invocations share only immutable snapshot definitions.
Independent arithmetic failures do not prevent other outputs from being computed.
Thirty-seven Rust tests pass. Public model ports now support named invocation,
required inputs, explicit optional defaults, and stable port identities. Formula
names bind only at edit submission; snapshots reuse stable-ID references.
Public values have extensible tagged value/type boundaries (Decimal-only today).

Invalidation, IEEE-754 and other non-decimal
values and daemon networking remain deferred. ADR-0004 is accepted after the review
refinements. The portable contract has generated Rust/C# codecs, numeric provenance
validation, explicit input sources, negotiated limits, and an in-process pivot-host
registry/dispatcher with mandatory handshake sessions. No socket/pipe service exists.
Local CI is available through `python scripts/ci.py`, covering Rust formatting,
lint/tests, .NET Release builds, and cross-language decimal compatibility. See
`docs/local-ci.md` for prerequisites and current platform/reproducibility limits.
