# Pivot implementation status

Date: 2026-10-18

The Rust workspace and .NET 10/Avalonia solution are scaffolded. Architecture
records live in `docs/adr/` using `ADR-NNNN` identifiers. ADR-0001 records the
previously agreed graph-first design.

`pivot-types` provides `PivotDecimal`, a private `rust_decimal` wrapper with
decimal text parsing, integer construction, formatting, comparisons, and checked
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and negation. Arithmetic errors
distinguish overflow and division by zero. Unrepresentable literals are rejected.
No float conversion API is exposed. Arithmetic outputs are canonicalized; explicit
rounding supports seven modes with nearest/ties-away-from-zero as default. .NET
helpers expose the same behavior. A shared 10,099-vector suite passes for values,
errors, and scales, including seeded arithmetic cases and independent rounding
expectations. See `tests/decimal-parity/verify.py` and the numeric architecture note.

`pivot-core::expression` parses decimal literals, ASCII identifiers, unary signs,
binary arithmetic, and parentheses into an AST. Multiplication/division precede
addition/subtraction; binary operators associate left. Names are case-preserving
and unresolved. The AST has no evaluation or I/O behavior.

Graph construction, evaluation, invalidation, cycles, model invocation, typed
non-numeric values, daemon behavior, and protocol implementation remain deferred.
M0 is not fully complete: CI and broader project documentation remain outstanding.
